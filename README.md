# Product Management Artifacts

A curated set of templates, examples, and frameworks I use to structure product discovery, delivery, and stakeholder communication.

Each file or folder represents a reusable artifact — from PRDs and OKRs to prioritization matrices and stakeholder maps.

---

## 📁 Structure

| Folder | Contents |
|---------|-----------|
| `/prd_templates` | Product Requirement Document templates and sample feature specs |
| `/roadmaps` | Example roadmaps (visuals and tables) |
| `/prioritization` | Scoring frameworks and decision matrices |
| `/okr_templates` | Goal-setting examples and KPI tracking formats |
| `/stakeholder_maps` | Communication plans and alignment visuals |
| `/user_flows` | Process diagrams and user journey sketches |

---

## 💡 Usage

- **Templates:** ready to copy and adapt.  
- **Examples:** anonymized documents inspired by real projects.  
- **Frameworks:** structured guides to apply consistently across teams.

Each artifact includes a short description, context of use, and version/date.
